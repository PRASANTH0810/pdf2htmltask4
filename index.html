    <p>As in any game, the success of competitive strategies depends on knowing the
        rules as well as the other players. Nevertheless, in the real competitive
        environment, the rules are not always clear and can change very quickly,
        demanding quick responses and making it increasingly difficult to map the
        moves of the main players.</p>

    <p>Strong monitoring channels must be maintained to follow changes in the
        competitive environment and to discern new trends. Changes in the environment 
        can result from emerging technologies or changes in society’s behavior,
        and thus in clients’ demands. They can also be the result of competitors’ moves
        in the market.</p>    

    <p>Thus developing a good competitive strategy depends on mapping the environment 
        and constantly monitoring it to be able to capitalize quickly on opportunities
         or neutralize threats.</p>

    <p>The focus of this chapter is on mapping the environment. It will show the main
        aspects of the model for industry analysis and explain the process of forming
        strategic groups and pressure maps.</p>

        <b><h2>Industry Analysis</h2></b>
        <hr>
        <p>Porter (1979) developed a model to analyze the environment based on
            mapping five competitive forces in order to better understand the rules of the
            competitive game and to help companies to find a position in the industry with
            greater clarity. During the 1990s, it was often remarked that environmental
            analysis had little to contribute given the turbulent state of the new economy, but
            Porter (2001) was able to demonstrate how important environmental analysis
            is, especially when there are a large number of uncertainties.</p>

        <p>A good map is most useful during a storm!</p>

        <p>To develop a map of an industry, one needs to know how the main players
            behave and how the battle for greater profitability works. According to Porter
            (1979), there are five competitive forces that run through an industry: customers, suppliers, current competitors, new entrants, and substitute products or
            services.</p>

        <p>Understanding these five forces is vital to formulating a company’s competitive
            strategy. The model for Industry Analysis is shown in Figure 2.1.
            </p>

        <p>The pressures exercised by these forces are structural determinants both of
            competition and of an industry’s profitability (Porter, 1979). In Figure 2.1, the
            battle for profitability in the supply chain, i.e., the bargaining power of</p>

        <p>customers and suppliers is laid out along the horizontal axis. The relationship
            among competitors, whether those are already established, potential entrants,
            or substitute products, is shown along the vertical axis.</p>

        <p>It is important to emphasize that industry, in this context, means an industrial
            sector and not a single company.</p>

        <p>The structure of an industrial sector depends on how the competitive forces are
            configured. When they are stronger, there is less potential for profitability. It is
            easy to imagine that within an industry with fierce competition, the rate of return
            tends to be less. On the outside limit, an industrial structure with all five forces
            intensified, approaches the economic model of “perfect competition.”</p>

        <p>On the other hand, there are industries where the five competitive forces are
            weak, i.e., the rivalry among existing competitors is not intense, the entry
            barriers for new competitors are difficult to overcome, and there are no
            substitute products. Allied to this favorable scenario, the sector is the driver of
            the supply chain, with high bargaining power with the others tiers in the chains,
            whether customers or suppliers. This type of industrial sector is called “five
            star” since it shows a high potential for profitability.</p>

        <p>Industry analysis allows us to identify which competitive forces most influence
            the industrial sector. It is common for one force in the competitive industrial
            environment to stand out and the competitive strategy should focus on it. It is
            then possible to influence the competitive environment in such a way as to
            assume a strategic position that can neutralize it, and thus to obtain a sustainable
            competition advantage, as seen in Chapter I.</p>

        <p>It is worth emphasizing that the map of the sector structure is dynamic, since the
            industry can undergo changes and, depending on the magnitude of the competitive movement of each player, the shape of the five forces can be altered, having
            an impact on its attractiveness.</p>

         <b><h3>Mapping the Competitive Forces in the Supply Chain:<br/>
            Relationships with Customers and Suppliers</h3></b>   
            <hr>
            <p>Bargaining power in the relationship with customers and suppliers has a
                decisive impact on both an industry’s profitability and attractiveness. Imagine
                the vehicle assembly plants and their auto parts suppliers seated around the
                bargaining table. It is east to predict that the scale will tilt toward the side of the
                assemblers.</p>

  <div class="section">
    <div class="content-container">
        <p>When the customers are concentrated and direct large volumes, such as the
            case of the assembly plants, they manage to bargain for better prices, increasing
            demands for quality, flexibility in the product mix and the volume of production,
            as well as access to information via Integrated Management Systems — ERP.
            They thus diminish the industry’s freedom to establish its own rules. This
            situation is aggravated when the products supplied by the industrial sector are
            standardized, are not critical to the quality of the customers’ production, and
            can be substituted without generating costs for the change (Carvalho et al.,
            2003).
            </p>
        <p>Table 2.1 shows some aspects, which determine the bargaining power of an
            industry, tilting the balance when they are present.
            </p>
        <p>When the forces in the supply chain are intense, it is important to outline a
            strategy for buyers and suppliers, with criteria for choosing buyers and for
            selecting target customers and also for developing a buying strategy, paying
            attention to strategic aspects and not just operational ones.
            </p>
        <p>This matrix proposed by Cox et al. (2001) is a useful tool for analyzing
            bargaining power between buyers and suppliers. Figure 2.2 shows the matrix,
            where the horizontal axis shows the dominance of the supplier and the vertical
            shows the dominance of the buyer, and four quadrants: buyer dominance,
            interdependence, independence, and supplier dominance.</p>
        <p>The quadrants of buyer dominance and supplier dominance indicate who has
            power over the other. In the independence quadrant, buyers and suppliers have
            attributes of power, and both must be involved in order to carry out any agreed
            upon exchanges. In the independence quadrant, neither of the two have
            attributes of power, nor are they capable of demanding that the other fulfill their
            requirements, and both have other opportunities for doing business.</p>

        <p>Yet in the more complex supply chains, a more detailed analysis of the
            relationship among the links must be done. It is necessary to identify which link
            commands the chain, i.e., dominates the strategic activities which add value.
            Two aspects take on special importance in this analysis, as we will see in more
            detail in Chapter III — governance of the chain and the value system.

        <b><h3>Analyzing the Competitors: Current, Potential and
            Substitutions</h3></b>
            <hr>
        <p>Competition in a given industry can be a factor that significantly limits profitability. In an industry with an intense rivalry, this can lead to predatory actions,
            eroding the attractiveness and profitability of the industry as a whole.</p>

            <p>It is important to note that rivalry should not be analyzed just in the context of
            existing competitors, but also in the extended rivalry which includes new
            entrants and substitute products and services, as illustrated in Figure 2.3. In
            industries that are threatened by substitute products or have a high potential for
            new entrants, competition tends to be sharper and often sets off price wars.</p>

            <p>There are many aspects that have an impact on the rivalry among established
            competitors in an industry and in the battle for market share and better
            competitive positioning. Imagine, for example, a sector where growth is slow
            or stagnant! For a company to grow, it has to take market shares from the</p>

        <p>competitors, increasing rivalry among the established competitors, which is not
            the case when the industry is growing overall.</p>
            <p>The main points to be verified in analyzing the forces of competition are:</p>

        <p>
•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Numerous or balanced competitors<br/>
•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slow growth of the industry<br/>
• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;High fixed costs<br/>
• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Absence of differentiation<br/>
• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Increased capacity in large increments<br/>
• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Competitors with divergent strategies<br/>
• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;High exit barriers
        </p>
    <p>When rivalry is extensive, the threat of new entrants to an industry is strongly
        related to the effective entry barriers and the expectation of potential competitors regarding retaliation from already established players.
        </p>
    <p>The main source of entry barriers for new competitors is the economies of
        scales, whether for production, research, marketing, or services, which require
        that the entrant operate on a large scale or which place the entrant at a cost
        disadvantage. In addition to this barrier, there are cost disadvantages, which
        are independent of scale, such as patent costs, access to raw material, location,
        official subsidies, and learning curves. For a long time, Xerox took advantage</p>

<p>of its patent for the copying machine to remain all alone in the market, however,
    when the patent expired, a lot of entrants such as Canon, Hewlett Packard, and
    others came on the scene.<br/><br/>
    According to Heizer and Render (1999), learning curve models were first
    observed for the aeronautics industry. It has been calculated that for the period
    1925-1957, the number of worker-hours per unit was reduced by 80%.<br/><br/>
    Learning curves, when applied to the context of strategy, allow us to determine
    changes in the volume-cost trade-off, and to evaluate performance for the
    business and the industry. The major restrictions to these models are related to
    the wide range of variables, which need to be analyzed, as illustrated in Figure
    2.4.<br/><br/>
    Other important sources of barriers are: <i>product differentiation, capital
    requirements, change cost and access to distribution channels.</i><br/><br/>
    The threat of new entrants can also affect expectations regarding retaliation
    from already established competitors, especially when excess capacity and/or
    capital are available to maintain and sustain a direct battle.<br/><br/>
    Finally, the last force of competition to be analyzed is the pressure of substitute
    products/services. Substitutes can be defined as those which carry out the same
    function, even with another technology base (another industry). Substitutes,
    which are subject to price/performance, trade off with products from the
    industry and/or those produced by five-star industries merit the most attention.</p>

            to the same forces of competition, they adopt different strategic positions with

    <p>An industry’s historical development explains differences in strategy and the
        barriers to mobility, which follows the players’ different resources and potentials, as well as their differences in terms of goals and positioning with regard
        to risk. This leads to the formation of strategic groups within the industry. Yet,
        changes in the industry’s structure can facilitate the formation of new strategic
        groups or make the groups homogenous.</p>
    <p>Strategic groups affect the barriers to mobility, bargaining power up and down
        the supply chain, the threat of substitutions and rivalry within the industry.
        Global barriers to entry differ greatly depending on the specific strategic group
        the newcomer intends to join, as well as creating barriers to changes of position
        from one strategic group to another. These barriers to mobility end up
        discouraging changing strategic position. High barriers explain differences in
        profitability between companies.
        </p>
    <p>Strategic groups can also affect bargaining power in the chain, since they confer
        different degrees of vulnerability on common buyers and suppliers. Strategic
        groups permit one to focus on different parts of the product line, to serve
        different customers, to operate with different levels of quality and technological
        innovation, and to have different cost positions, minimizing the level of exposure
        to competition from substitute products.</p>
    <p>The presence of several strategic groups almost always affects the level of
        rivalry inside the industry, since there can be interdependence among the
        groups in the market or in their degree of overlap in targeting customers. The
        possibility of product differentiation achieved by the groups, the number and
        relative size of the strategic groups, strategic distancing between groups, or the
        degree of divergence of strategy are other factors that have impact on the global
        rivalry of the industry.
        </p>
        <p>A company’s viability, as a function of its chosen strategic group, is affected by
            the structural analysis within the industry, as we have seen. Still, other factors
            affect the profitability of a company or group, such as the position of the
            company inside its group, the degree of competition within the group, the scale
            of the company in relation to others in the group, the cost of entry into the group,
            and the company’s ability to execute and implement its chosen strategy in
            operational terms.</p>

        <p>It is worth stressing that it is not always true that a company with a larger market
            share is more viable. Larger companies will be more viable if they compete in
            strategic groups more protected by barriers to mobility and with a stronger position
            in the chain, and the smaller companies will be more viable if there are no large
            economies of scale and if they adopt differentiated strategies for service and
            technological innovation. This exception should not be taken as a rule, since that
            could lead to a commodity trap. The view that cost position is the sole sustainable
            factor on which a competitive strategy can be built, which can invade the territory
            of other areas of strategy, is not easily sustainable, an, in global low-cost positioning,
            is not always necessarily important.

            <b><h3>SWOT Analysis and Strategic Groups</h3></b>
            <hr>
            <p>The analysis and choice of which strategic groups one should compete in has
                implications in formulating strategy. Hence, these decisions have to take into
                consideration the comparison between a company’s strengths and weaknesses, whether they are structural or related to implementing the selected
                strategy, and they must highlight distinctive competencies in order to maximize
                opportunities and minimize threats arising from the competitive environment.
                The SWOT analysis seen in Chapter I, allows us to visualize the impact of
                strategic groups on strategy in a structured way as illustrated in Table 2.1.</p>

            <b><h3>Strategic Groups Map</h3></b>
            <hr>
            <p>The map of strategic groups presents a graphic demonstration of competition
                in an industry, identifying the relative position of the diverse adversaries within it.
                The map of strategic groups is laid out along two axes, which contain the critical
                dimensions for industry analysis, usually dealt with at two levels, high and low,
                as illustrated in Figure 2.5. Hence, the first step in mapping is to select the
                strategic variables that will be used along the axes. In order to do so, one needs
                to decide which variables determine the most important barriers to mobility for
                the industry.</p>
                <p>An analysis using maps of the strategic groups permits:</p>

    <p>Feka et al. (1997) state that total revenue can measure the size of each
        company, while its business focus can be seen in the percentage of sales in
        relation to the company’s total revenue. The market share of the analyzed
        company’s product in relation to its competitors determines its market positioning. However, it is important to stress that other measurements could be
        used to represent better the competitive environment in a specific industry.
        </p>
    
        <b><h3>Competitive Pressure Diagram</h3></b>
        <hr>
        <p>Another instrument to map the competitive environment is the competitive
            pressure diagram (D’Aveni, 2002). According to this author: “The more two
            firms’ products or geographic markets overlap, the more pressure they exert
            on each other. The pressure is proportional to the importance of markets to
            each firm and their degree of penetration. This simple concept enables
            organizations to quantify the degree of pressure that one rival puts on another.”
            As D’Aveni writes, pressure systems can never be frozen; the best that can be
            achieved is a kind of ‘dynamic stability’.</p>
        <p>D’Aveni (2002) states that the competitive pressure from a given incursion into
            a rival’s geographical or product market can be measured by two factors: the
            importance of the market (I.M.) and the size of the incursion (S.I.). This
            pressure is given by the formula:</p>
            <center>
                <p>Competitive Pressure = I.M. S.I.&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; (1)</p>
            </center>

            <ul class="styled-list">
                <li><p><b>I.M.:</b> The percentage of the targeted firm’s total revenue represented by
                    the market;
                    </p></li>
                <li><p><b>S.I.:</b> The market share achieved by the invading firm</p></li>

        <p>Similarly, to the strategic groups, the pressures map is valid just for a short period.
            In this diagram, each circle represents one of the market players and arrows
            represent the pressure each player is exercising on the others. The diameters of the
            companies’ representative circles mean the size of the respective market share at
            that moment. The width of the arrows in the diagram indicates the intensity of the
            pressures.</p>
            <p>These pressure maps can be also useful to take decisions about, offensive or
                defensive moves, in conjunction with other decision-making tools like the
                rivalry matrix, decision trees, and Game Theory. However, Furrer and Thomas
                (2000) warn that the analyzed market should have few decision variables and
                a predictable environment.</p>
            <p>In both kinds of competitive environment maps, data about the market should
                be obtained from secondary sources in order to construct these diagrams.

                    to Adequate Positioning</h2></b>
                    <hr>
                    <p>Identifying the competencies a company needs in order to gain competitive
                        advantage in a market which is in constant mutation is an arduous task.
                        However, the capacity for knowing its potential and developing it in a consistent
                        way can be decisive for a successful positioning on the competitive scene.
                        As we saw in Chapter I, self-knowledge propounded by Sun Tzu and other
                        philosophers is a decisive weapon in the competitive game.
                        The focus of this chapter is to discuss how a company should position its
                        competitive strategy in order to maximize its competencies, but without losing
                        sight of the competitive state of the industry overall.
                        </p>
                        <b><h3>Core Competencies</h3></b>
                        <hr>
                        <p>The word competence comes from the Latin, <i>competere</i>. The derivation of the
                            concept of competencies can be seen by taking apart the Latin word: <i>com</i>,
                            which means <i>together</i> and <i>petere</i>, which means <i>effort</i>. Identifying the set of
                            forces that will be able to lead the organization to build a sustainable competitive advantage is vital in the context of strategy. (Rabechini Jr. & Carvalho,

        <p>
            Prahalad and Hamel (1990) relate the competitive success of a corporation to
its ability to identify, cultivate, and exploit its core competencies.<br/><br/>
For these authors, competitiveness in the long-run derives from the ability to
build core competencies more rapidly and at a lower cost than the competition.
To build them, it is necessary to meld a broad range of abilities in production
and technology with competencies the enable individual deals and adapt rapidly
to new opportunities, generating competitive advantage for the corporation.<br/><br/>
In cultivating core competencies, the corporation manages to share costs, without
needing to invest more than the competition in research and development.<br/><br/>
Figure 2.6 represents the diversified corporation as a large tree. The trunk and
larger branches are the core products, the smaller branches are the business units;
the leaves, flowers, and fruits are the final product. The roots are core competencies,
whose function is to distribute nutrients and provide stability to the tree.<br/><br/>
Each part of the tree determines a different plane of competition: core
competencies, core products, and final products. The battles for market
partners are engaged at each of these levels, and leadership in final products
does not imply leadership at the other levels. Being given a dominant position
in relation to core products allows a company to mold the evolution of
application and finals markets and managing to achieve economies of scale and
of scope, since the market share of core products can come from multiple
industries.
        </p>

        and Hamel, 1990)</p></i>

    <div class="content-container">

        <p>Core products incorporate one or more core competencies, making the link
            between core competencies and final products. These products are the key
            components of various final products and contribute to generating value in the
            final product, materializing core competencies. According to Prahalad and
            Hamel (1990), Matsushita holds 45% of the market in the manufacturing of key
            components for VCRs (core product), while its brands participation in the final
            product (Panasonic, JVC) represents 20% of the market. Another of
            Matsushita’s core products is the compressor, with 40% of the world market,
            while its participation in air conditioners and refrigerators is quite small.<br/><br/>
            The concept of core competencies is decisive both for services and manufacturing.
            In contrast to final products that are consumed upon use, core competencies are
            enhanced when applied or shared, even though if they are not well-constructed,
            they can be lost since knowledge also deteriorates.<br/><br/>
            Core competencies require a commitment to working on organizational frontiers, involving different business units, several levels of hierarchy and different
            functions. Consequently, the traditional concept of a corporation unnecessarily
            limits individuals’ abilities by making functional cut-offs that patchwork the
            corporation into autonomous business units, makes core competencies more
            difficult to achieve.
            </p>
            <i><p>Identifying Core Competencies</p></i>
            <hr style="height: 1.2px;">
            <p>According to Prahalad and Hamel (1990), it is hard to build world leadership
                when based in more than five or six core competencies. Consequently, if a
                corporation has not yet managed to achieve a lean list of competencies, it can
                apply at least three tests to identify them, as follows:
                </p>
                <ul class="styled-list">
                    <li><p><b>First test: </b>Provides access to a broad variety of markets;</p></li>
                    <li><p><b>Second test:</b> Makes a significant contribution to the benefits perceived
                        by consumers in the final product;</p></li>
                    <li><p><b>Third test:</b>  It is hard for competitors to imitate.
                    </p></li>
                </ul>
                <p>To aid in this process, it is interesting to have recourse to the idea of the tree,
                    extending the concept of core competencies to core products, and finally, to
                    end products. To make this extension in a consistent way, it is suggested that
                    the company reflect on the following questions:</p>

        <ul class="styled-list">
            <li><p>How long can competitiveness in business survive if the core competencies are not controlled?</p></li>
            <li><p>How central are these core competencies, in terms of generating value for
                the client?</p></li>
            <li><p>What future opportunities will be lost if these particular competencies are lost?
            </p></li>
        </ul>

        <p>It is important to keep in mind that the complex harmonization of individual
            technologies and abilities needed to build core competencies cannot be simply
            acquired by a competitor. It might even acquire some of the technology, but
            would not be able to duplicate the pattern of internal coordination and learning.<br/><br/>
            Another important component for self-knowledge is to identify which generic
            strategies will permit a more adequate positioning in order to construct
            sustainable competitive advantages.</p>

            can be broken down into two parts, the first deriving from the average
            performance of all its competitors, and the second to the company’s performance relative to the sector.<br/><br/>
            The issue to be discussed in this chapter is the company’s positioning in order
            to obtain sustainable competitive advantage. This advantage should guarantee
            the company greater income that the average of the sector where it is active.<br/><br/>
            According to Porter (1979), there are two basic kinds of competitive advantage: leadership in cost or differentiation. Besides, the scope of strategic action
            should be defined. The target can be a broader market as a target, with several
            or restricted, acting only in a specific segment.<br/><br/>
            Based in these two dimensions, there are four possible generic strategies, as
            illustrated in the quadrants of Figure 2.7. The generic strategies are: leadership
            in cost, differentiation, focus on cost, and focus on differentiation.<br/><br/>
            Defining a generic competitive strategy aims at establishing a favorable,
            profitable, and sustainable competitive position, against the forces that comprise the competition in an industry. Not doing clear positioning in one of these
            strategies can result in inferior performance, with a high risk that the company</p>

        <p>has an average performance because of the different trade-off of these two
            kinds of strategies.<br/><br/>
            In addition, the company disposes itself to deliver two distinct types of value
            packages for the client (cost and differentiation) or to oscillate between them
            over time, and this can confuse its image to customers and cause it to lose
            credibility and its reputation.<br/><br/>
            The alignment of all an organization’s activities around a generic strategy makes
            its implementation easier, as well as its communication with customers, employees, and stockholders. Finally, when the strategic positioning is not clear and
            the trade-offs are not made explicit, it is hard to build the needed resources,
            creating problems with internal coordination Porter (1996). In this manner, the
            most critical position in terms of strategic positioning is the central region, as
            highlighted in Figure 2.7.<br/><br/>
            Nonetheless Deschamps and Nayak (1995) warn that this or-or type proposition can lead to errors of interpretation called the Commodity Trap. The
            Commodity Trap comes from an error of interpretation that associates strategies of differentiation to small, specialized companies active in segments or
            niches of the market, leaving it to the large companies to adopt strategies of low
            cost.<br/><br/>
            Before defining the generic strategy, it is important to verify the positioning of
            the competitors, by making a detailed structural analysis inside the industry,</p>

        <p>highlighting the major strategic groups and their dimensions. Remember that the
            essence of good strategic positioning is selecting activities that distinguish the
            company from its competitors.
            We stress that, in principle, the strategy of cost leadership is not intrinsically
            better than that of differentiation or vice versa. Everything depends on the
            external context and the unique conditions of each company!
            </p>
        <i><p>Cost Leadership</p></i>
        <hr style="height: 1.2px;">
        <p>The company that seeks leadership in cost has to focus the entire organization
            to achieve this objective, creating a culture of low costs, working constantly to
            reduce waste and remaining constantly attentive to the cost positions of its
            competitors.
            </p>
            <p>In order to obtain this advantage, the company needs to make trade-offs, such
                as letting go of greater variety and flexibility in favor of lower costs. On the other
                hand, this does not mean that the company that adopts this strategy will have
                poor-quality products.</p>
            <p>The corporation that competes in this strategy has to create a gap in cost
                performance in relation to other competitors in the industry, which allows it to
                increase margins of profit, as illustrated in Figure 2.8. If the company manages
                to establish a level for costs which is much lower than the competition, but at
                the same time sets off a price war, this will reduce the margins and consequently
                its profitability. The goal is to work with costs well below average for the
                industry but to set prices only slightly lower than the competition.<br/>

        <p>Companies such as the airline GOL, are always searching in different areas,
            involving quick in flight service, that doesn’t require preparation and facilitates
            the later cleaning of the airplane, quick boarding and debarking procedures,
            making equipment available more rapidly for new flights, as well as investing in
            technology and maintenance focused on operational efficiency.
            The bases for competition in this strategy are shaken up when competitors are
            able to quickly overcome the gap, eroding the bases for cost leadership, or
            when technology changes, eliminating advantages of scale, for example.
            </p>

            <i><p>Differentiation</p></i>
            <hr style="height: 1.2px;">

            <p>
                The rationale for a generic strategy of differentiation is also to increase the
company margin starting from the price variable, not the cost variable<br/><br/>
The goal of the companies that compete for differentiation is to identify and
satisfy customers’ needs, but those needs for which the client is inclined to pay
a premium price. Therefore, the greater viability obtained in this business profile
derives form the price premium. This does not mean, however, that companies
that compete with this generic strategy can disregard the price variable. Once
the target for differentiation has been defined, only costs associated to
differentiation can be absorbed. In other aspects, the company should also
exercise careful daily cost management, if it doesn’t, it will be eliminating the
margin obtained from the premium price with excessive costs as illustrated in
Figure 2.9.<br/><br/>
Companies such as the Brazilian airline TAM seek out added value by offering
differentiated services to the client which allows it to charge more, and it clearly
communicates the difference to the client — “TAM’s way of flying”. To add

        <p>value, it offers a more customized service in the air as well as on land. In opting
            for this approach, the trade-offs with the lower-cost positioning are explicit.</p>
<p>Results of competitive advantage in differentiation usually lead to investments
    in innovation and technology, always with the focus on the specific needs of the
    customers which add value, as well as the use of more specialized labor who
    in counterpart obtain higher remuneration.
    </p>
    <p>The bases for competition in this strategy are shaken when the competitors are
        able to quickly manage to imitate the target of differentiation offering very
        similar packages of value or the differentiated object loses importance due to
        changes in the environment. For this reason, these companies have to be always
        in motion, improving performance and innovating more rapidly than their
        competitors.
        </p>
<p>This strategy implies higher risks, since the target of differentiation chosen by
    the company will not be able to obtain a premium price. In this case, the
    company will have costs higher than the industry average, without being able to
    charge more for its extra costs, since customers don’t see value in the package
    offered. This happened with several retail companies that decided to differentiate their products through selling on the Internet, but didn’t manage to add
    value, since the average consumer hasn’t even got a computer, and they
    suffered losses with B2C (business-to-consumer).</p>
    <i><p>Focus</p></i>
    <hr style="height: 1.2px;">
    <p>The generic strategy of focus, on cost as well as differentiation, has many things
        in common with the strategies of cost leadership and differentiation,
         respectively. Basically, they differ in competitive scope.</p>
    <p>The key to this strategy is to find the lucrative, sustainable target segment to
        exercise the strategy, whether of cost or differentiation. This focus on a segment
        allows the company to develop performance superior to its competitors, who
        have multiple targets. This segmentation can be a function of a geographic cut,
        or of scale, or an activity that reaches a specific type of consumer.
        </p>
        <p>Once the target segment has been selected, the company has to devote all its
            efforts consistently in this direction, clearly communicating its option to the
            market. To have greater success in selecting the segment to implement the
            strategy of focus, segments that are more needy than others must be prioritized.</p>
            <p>As with the strategy of differentiation, here the risks are also high since in
                addition to the specific trade-offs of strategy of cost or differentiation, there are</p>

        <p>trade-offs related to the target segment, for example, abandoning distribution
            channels. In case the trade-offs made do not result in value for the customers,
            these choices end up generating performance inferior to the industry average.
            </p>

            <p>Auto assembly plants engaged in much more respectful competition in the past
                than now. Partnerships such as Autolatina in Brazil, shared between Volkswagen
                and Ford, from 1987 to 1995, were viable in the closed market, but ceased to
                be so with the opening of commerce. The number of competitors with plants in
                the country multiplied, from those already installed before the opening, GM,
                Fiat, and Toyota, to those of the French – Renault, Peugeot, and Citroën; and
                the Japanese with Honda. Presently the majority of models produced in Brazil
                are of European origin.</p>
                <p>To aggravate the situation, the automotive industry began to experience slow
                    growth during that period, which led to even sharper competition.
                    </p>
                <p>The assemblers depended more on the supply of components produced and
                    supplied by the first tier suppliers, with higher added value, which related to
                    second and third level tiers in the supply chain, who manufactured sub-sets and

        <p>In the 1980s, the Pão de Açúcar Group, the largest supermarket chain in Brazil,
            was the largest major supermarket chain present in Belém, but ended up
            beating a retreat during the group’s restructuring. The Bom-Preço channel also
            gave up fighting over Belem´s consumers, closing 10 stores in 1993.</p>
<p>Local groups were very aggressive in defending their territory, balancing
    modernizing of their stores with their regional roots. Peculiarities of local
    demand are very marked. Regional customs make the residents of Belem very
    particular consumers of things such as vegetables typical of the region, such as
    jambu, bacuri, cupuaçu, teperebá, or uxi, and the substitution of fresh milk with
    powdered milk. Imagine the effort needed to supply customized products for
    department stores or supermarkets in this city!</p>
    <p>Due to their good knowledge of the characteristics of the local market, the local

    <p>The bologna market in metropolitan São Paulo, Brazil, is highly competitive.
        The main players are six high competitive companies with strong local brands:
        Cardeal, Ceratti, Marba, Rezende, Sadia, and Perdigão.
        </p>
<p>Two pressure maps were drawn and each diagram is a picture of the São
    Paulo’s bologna market for each period analyzed. For the studied industry, it
    was assumed that the importance of the market (I.M.) was the percentage of
    bologna in the company’s total revenue and the size of the incursion (S.I.) was
    the market share achieved reached by each analyzed player.
    </p>
    <p>The strongest pressure ordinarily gets the quickest or the most effective
        response. Figure 2.10 shows a competitive pressures map, which represents
        the beginning of a great offensive movement of Ceratti over its stronger
        competitor, Marba, with significant reflexes on the others. It seems that Marba
        did not make any effort to avoid the imminent aggression from Ceratti.

    <hr>
<p>At the end of the 1980s, NEC emerged as a leader in the area of semiconductors
    and as one of the major competitors in producing telecommunications and
    computers. In addition to consolidating its position in mainframes for computers and
    acting in the areas of public commuters and transmitters, it began to produce
    products for everyday use such as cell phones, faxes, laptops — linking
    telecommunications and office automation.</p>

            NEC is the only company among the five major revenues in telecommunications,
semiconductors, and mainframes industries.<br/><br/>
In the beginning of the 1970s, NEC articulated a strategy to explore the convergence
of computers with communications, which was called “C&C.” The success of this
management strategy resulted in the acquisition of competencies, especially in
semiconductors. NEC formed the “C&C Committee” composed of high-level
executives to supervise the development of its core products and core competencies
alongside its individual business interests. In accordance with its strategic structure,
NEC transferred enormous resources to fortify its position in components and
central processors. By employing collaborative arrangements to multiply its internal
resources, NEC was ready to accumulate a vast range of core competencies.<br/><br/>
NEC carefully identified three channels for technological evolution and interrelated
markets, involving things from its large mainframes to distribution processes,
components from simple ICs to VSLI, and communications from mechanical
exchange bars to complex digital systems that we now call ISDN. Finally, NEC
determined that semiconductors would be its most important product.<br/><br/>
To build up its competencies rapidly and at low cost, NEC got involved in numerous
numbers of strategic alliances, which numbered over 100 just in 1987. In
mainframes, the best-known alliance was with Honeywell and Bull. Almost all the
arrangements in the area of semiconductors and components were oriented toward
access to technology. The research director at NEC summed up this acquisition of
competencies during the 1970s and 1980s thusly, “From the point of view of
investment, it was much cheaper and quicker to use outside technology. There was
no need for us to develop new ideas.”<br/><br/>

        <b><h3>Case – In Search of a Generic Strategy at Bunge</h3></b>
        <hr>
        <p>
            The Bunge group, the third largest processor of soy in the world, with billing of
10 billion dollars per year, is active in Brazil, Argentina, and the United States.<br/><br/>
Brazil is responsible for about half of world sales, and it is only here that the
group has a consumer goods division, Santista Foods, with 20 factories and
over 100 brand names that range from breads to margarines.<br/><br/>
About three years ago, the Bunge stockholders resolved to focus on the
agricultural commodities market to compete with the Americans, Cargill and
ADM, the two largest corporations in the sector.<br/><br/>
Based on this decision, several business units were sold, but Santista, which
had been put up for sale in 1998, remained. According to a former Santista

<p>
    executive: “the consumer area always represents the least part of Bunge’s
    billing and 90% of its headaches,” constituting a kind of foreign body in the
    Bunge organism, since the integration of this company into the global strategy
    has required major efforts by its executives.<br/><br/>
    Santista has been devalued by about 10 million dollars since its acquisition by
    the Bunge group, with significant liquid losses in 2000, causing Bunge’s entire
    Brazil operation to close in the red.<br/><br/>
    The total profit on other operations — pulled by the fertilizer area — was about
    60 million dollars “Despite the slips in the consumer areas, the group has been
    very successful with its strategy in the area of commodities and fertilizers,” says
    Luciana Massaad, investment analyst for the Itaú Bank.<br/><br/>
    The solution to problems caused by maintaining a division foreign to Bunge’s
    focus has to do with the challenge of valorizing Santista Foods and Sears,
    separating out the businesses that are of interest to the group, integrating them
    into the global strategy, and selling off the rest, preferably for a good price.<br/><br/>
    Many of Bunge’s difficulties with the consumer area come from the group’s
    traditional vocation in the area of agricultural commodities. This has been the
    group’s area of competency since 1818, when it founded the Koninklijke
    Bunge in Amsterdam to import grain from the Dutch colonies. Looking for
    wheat, Bunge arrived in Argentina in 1874. In 1906 it landed in Brazil, acquiring
    Moinho Santista. During periods of prosperity for wheat, the food group began
    to develop around these mills, which became accustomed to large volume
    business. The executives trained at Bunge were never close to the consumer
    market as were the teams from companies such as Unilever, one of the
    principals of Santista Alimentos in the area of margarine and mayonnaise. Until
    a short while ago, sales personnel spoke of tons of bread sold and not in units,
    as this is normally referred to in other consumer goods companies. “We will
    never be like a Unilever or Nestlé in terms of brand name management,” says
    Weisser.<br/><br/>
    The strategy of the team led by Weisser, at least up until now, has been to
    eliminate the less profitable brands from Santista Alimentos. Some products
    have also bee redirected to large institutional clients, such as bakeries.
    “Publicity efforts are not needed in order to serve this market,” says analyst/
    Luciana, from Itaú. “What is important is volume. And Bunge understands
    volume.”<br/><br/>
    The idea is to integrate Santista more and more into Bunge Foods, Bunge’s
    Food Company in the United States, which does not have consumer brand
